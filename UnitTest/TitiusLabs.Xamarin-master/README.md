# TitiusLabs.Xamarin

This is a set of plugins, controls, class that I currently use in my Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms projects.

The project contains:

- a custom set of Xamarin.Forms controls
  - TLEntry: a custom entry with some enhanced capabilities;
  - TLScrollView: a simple ScrollView bindable with a short list of items that can be show horizontally;
  - TLImageCircle: show an image in a circle view
